"""Object-level access: may this user touch this one record?

List endpoints narrow by role inside their own queries; this module is the same
rule applied to a single record fetched by id. Each record is judged by the
owner column its list filters on, so whatever a list shows can be opened and
nothing it hides can be.

Admins are unrestricted; a manager reaches whatever sits with someone on their
team (themselves and their direct reports); a sales rep reaches only their own.
A record with no owner therefore reaches only admins -- `None` is neither the
rep's own id nor a member of any team list -- and a record that does not exist
is refused the same way, so a caller can answer both with one response and
never confirm that an id exists.
